# Unit 4: Math project

## Criteria A: Planning
**Problem defenition**

Cliant M is a student studying in ISAK. He is a math enthusiast to the point of enthusiasm, solving difficult math problems and making new math theorems on a daily life. He wants a place on the Internet where he can share his mathematical theorems, problems, and solutions. In the Network, he requires the Login and Register system for using his own account. And he requested to be able to post text and pictures for showing some graphs/fiugre. Also, he strongly requested to be able to use some math text type(ex;Latex, Katex, ...), to make it easy to visuallise. Additionally, he reqires to be able to send some personal message to onother account, for error reporting and collaborative research.

**Proposed Solution**

Design Statement to solve my client's problem, I will create an application to post the information about math. I will be using Python as the primary programing launguage for the application, HTML and CSS for the graphical user interface(GUI), and SQLite to manipulate the database in which the post and account logs will be stored. The application will consist a login page, registration page, main page, post page, edit page and chat page.

System The application to manage appliance usage will be developed on the programming editor PyCharm version 2022.3.2, run on a 2020 MacBook Pro using the OS macOS Big Sur version 13.2.1. Through PyCharm, the application will be coded using Python, HTML and CSS for the GUI, and SQLite to manipulate the database.

**Design statement**

Software Justification
Python

Python is an ideal programming language for this application due to its versatility, especially when it comes to handling data and working with databases. The use of Python will also allow for the integration of math text types such as Latex and Katex, which will be essential for visualizing mathematical formulas and theorems. Additionally, Python's robust library support will make it possible to implement the necessary features for the login, registration, messaging, and posting functionality efficiently. Therefore, Python is the ideal choice for this project due to its flexibility, simplicity, and efficient development capabilities.


HTML and CSS
HTML and CSS are essential for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application, allowing the client to interact with the system and post mathematical theorems, problems, and solutions. HTML is used to create the structure and content of web pages, while CSS is used to style and format them. Additionally, HTML can be used to incorporate math text types like Latex and Katex, as requested by the client, which will make it easy for the client to visualize mathematical expressions.


SQLite

SQLite is an ideal choice for this application as it provides a lightweight, self-contained, and efficient database management system that can handle the data storage and retrieval needs of this application. Additionally, SQLite offers excellent compatibility with Python, which I am gonna use for this application. Overall, SQLite's reliability, efficiency, and compatibility make it an excellent choice for managing the database in this math-sharing application.



**Success Criteria**

1. Make Login system and Register system (Encrypt password)
2. Make Adding posts(title, content, account) system.
3. Able to use Tex font style for the post.
4. Able to comment to the post.
5. Make posts editing system.
6. Able to do the private chat between multiple accounts.
