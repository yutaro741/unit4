# Unit 4: 

## Criteria A: Planning
**Problem defenition**
Cliant M is a student studying in ISAK. He is a math enthusiast to the point of enthusiasm, solving difficult math problems and making new math theorems on a daily life. He wants a place on the Internet where he can share his mathematical theorems, problems, and solutions. In the Network, he requires the Login and Register system for using his own account. And he requested to be able to post text and pictures for showing some graphs/fiugre. Also, he strongly requested to be able to use some math text type(ex;Latex, Katex, ...), to make it easy to visuallise. Additionally, he reqires to be able to send some personal message to onother account, for error reporting and collaborative research.

## Problem definition

## Proposed Solution

**Design statement**

Proposed Solution
Proposed solution: Design Statement To solve my client's problem, I will create an application to manage the tasks for Mr.B. I will be using Python as the primary programming language for the application, KivyMD for the graphical user interface (GUI), and SQLite to manipulate the database in which the tasks logs will be stored. The application will consist of a login page, a registration page, main page, page to edit the task, and page to see all of the task.

System The application to manage appliance usage will be developed on the programming editor PyCharm version 2022.3.2, run on a 2020 MacBook Pro using the OS macOS Big Sur version 13.2.1. Through PyCharm, the application will be coded using Python, KivyMD for the GUI, and SQLite to manipulate the database.

Software Justification
Python

I have chosen to use Python as the primary programming language for several reasons. Firstly, Python is a high-level language that is easy to understand and write due to its simple syntax. It is ideal for beginners as it is accessible while also being practical and flexible for a variety of projects.2 Furthermore, Python is one of the fastest growing programming languages3, with a vast online community of developers who can offer resources and support. Secondly, I have extensive experience in Python, and it is my go-to language. This familiarity will save me time, enabling the project to run more efficiently than if I had to learn a new language. Finally, Python is an object-oriented programming language, which is perfect for this project. OOP frameworks are modular, making it easier to identify issues in the code, and the code can be reused through inheritance. Moreover, functions can be flexible and usable across multiple classes due to polymorphism. All of these factors make Python the best choice for this project.

KivyMD

To create the graphical user interface for this project, I have decided to use KivyMD, an open-source library that specializes in creating graphical user interfaces (GUI) for applications.4 The GUI will serve as the primary mode of communication between the user and the program. Through the GUI, the user can input commands and view information via their keyboard and computer screen, while the program manipulates the database to create, add, edit, and delete data. As the GUI plays a crucial role in this application, it is essential that it is easy to navigate and user-friendly. KivyMD provides a range of features that will enable me to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface. With the GUI in place, the client and any other user, even those without experience in programming, will be able to easily access the logs and interact with the program.

SQLite

I have chosen to use SQLite as the database management system for this project. SQLite is a lightweight, embedded relational database engine that is perfect for small to medium scale projects.5 It's highly efficient, fast and reliable, making it a popular choice for developers. Additionally, SQLite is open source and requires no setup or administration, making it easy to integrate with any project.6 With its ability to handle large amounts of data and its support for SQL, SQLite provides a powerful solution for data storage and retrieval. Furthermore, SQLite is cross-platform compatible, which means that the application can run seamlessly on different operating systems such as Windows, Linux and macOS.

Success Criteria
So, the success criteria that best fulfils his requirements are as follows.

Login and Register system (Encrypt password)
Adding journal (Name, category, due date, tag color)
Be able to Edit journal
Be able to change color easily
Be able to delete the task finished with one button
Be able to pick the date easely.
